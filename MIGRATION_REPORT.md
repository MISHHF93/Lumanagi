# Lumanagi Migration Report

## Overview
- Removed all Base44 SDK dependencies, brand assets, and configuration.
- Replaced the legacy client with an Axios-based API layer featuring auth interceptors and resilience fallbacks.
- Introduced typed governance entities in `src/lib/entities.ts` backed by seeded offline data stores.
- Added custom Zustand-style stores for authentication and UI state, exposed via `AuthProvider`.
- Normalized layout, routing, and command modal behavior to rely on centralized state.
- Added Node-based smoke tests for the AI Governance module using a lightweight React Testing Library shim (`test/rtl-shim.tsx`).
- Refreshed project metadata (`package.json`, `index.html`, `.env.example`, `README.md`).

## Follow-up Recommendations
- Connect Axios client to live backend endpoints once available.
- Extend the testing harness with more integration coverage (charts, async flows).
- Audit remaining UI components for TypeScript adoption or prop typing.
- Integrate real authentication token exchange in `AuthProvider` when backend is ready.
